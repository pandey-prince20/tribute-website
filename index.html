                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈəbdʊl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and <br>
                statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu,<br>
                studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the <br> Defence
                Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's <br>civilian
                space programme and military missile development efforts.[2] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the <br>
                development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[3][4][5] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political <br>role in
                India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[6]
